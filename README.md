# Design a smart contract where:
1. A contract owner (manufacturer) can issue car records, default ownership goes to him
2. An owner can transfer ownership to a new owner
3. 2-step car sell process
4. A buyer requests to sell a car and sends some value in ETH
5. The current owner approves and changes the ownership
6. Smart contract works as an escrow
